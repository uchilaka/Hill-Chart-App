# Hill Chart App

A simple React application for generating your very own hill charts.

> Alternative, you can accomplish a one-off version of this by following teh example of the BaseCamp team and creating an ObservableHQ fork

## How is this different from using ObservableHQ?

You can save as many files as you want within this React version, and use the instructions in *generating new charts* below to change the output chart.

## Getting Started

Simply clone this repository and run in your containerized / node / own Stackblitz project

## Generating new charts

You can update the data input of the chart by updating the `data` prop passed to the `Chart` component.

## Future work

* Read the interactions with the chart, and output corresponding (updated) chart data that can be used to generate an updated version of the plotted chart.
* Publish a standalone app / extension that saves chart data locally.

## Fini
